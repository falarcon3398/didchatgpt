The Amazon EC2 product manager is Chris.  EC2 is supported and approved for Production. EC2 FAQ https//www.myco.com/ec2/faqs/. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a central component of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides on-demand, resizable, and highly scalable virtual computing resources in the cloud. With EC2, users can launch virtual servers, known as instances, to run applications and services without the need for physical hardware. These instances come in various configurations, offering different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities to suit a wide range of use cases.One of EC2's key advantages is its scalability. Users can easily adjust the number of instances up or down to accommodate changing workloads, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency. EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means customers are billed only for the computing capacity they consume, eliminating the upfront capital expenditures associated with traditional on-premises infrastructure. Security is a top priority for AWS, and EC2 provides robust security features. Users can deploy instances within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to isolate their network environments. Security groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) offer fine-grained control over inbound and outbound traffic, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows administrators to manage access and permissions.EC2 instances can be integrated seamlessly with other AWS services, facilitating complex and scalable architectures. Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) distribute traffic across multiple instances for enhanced availability, while services like Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 can be used to store and manage data.Overall, EC2 empowers organizations of all sizes to quickly and cost-effectively deploy and manage their computing workloads in a secure, scalable, and flexible manner, making it a foundational service in the world of cloud computing. 

The Amazon Lambda Product Manager is named Chris.  This service is approved for Production.  For Support Contact  DL_EHS_Clould@myco.org.  Lambda FAQ https//www.myco.com/lambda/faqs/.  ASW functions, often referred to simply as "lambdas," are a key concept in computer programming, particularly in functional programming and modern serverless computing environments. A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be used as an argument to other functions, returned from functions, or even assigned to variables. What sets lambda functions apart is their simplicity and lack of a formal name or identifier. Lambda functions are particularly powerful in languages like Python, JavaScript, and others that support functional programming paradigms. They are often used for tasks like filtering data, transforming lists, or defining short, throwaway functions for specific operations. Lambda functions are concise and eliminate the need to define a full-fledged named function when a simple operation is required. In the context of serverless computing, such as AWS Lambda, a lambda function refers to a piece of code that is executed in response to specific events without the need to manage servers or infrastructure. Developers can upload their code, define the triggering events (e.g., HTTP requests, database changes), and AWS Lambda automatically handles the scaling and execution of the code. This approach allows for cost-effective, event-driven computing and is well-suited for building microservices, APIs, and event-driven applications. In summary, lambda functions are a versatile and fundamental concept in programming, both for simplifying code in traditional programming languages and for enabling serverless computing in cloud environments. Their concise and anonymous nature makes them a valuable tool for writing more expressive and efficient code while reducing the management overhead of traditional server-based architectures.
